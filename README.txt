Four systems have been developed, all pre-indexed.

1) basic_freq_p = Basic system that uses the TF formula (freq/P) to calculate TF for TF*IDF

2) basic_log = Basic system that uses the TF formula (1 + log(tf)) to calculate TF for TF*IDF

3) stem_freq_p = Improved system that uses stemming and stop words, also uses the TF formula (freq/P) to calculate TF for TF*IDF. NOTE: this is the system that retrieves the BEST RESULTS!!!

4) stem_log = Improved system that uses stemming and stop words, also uses the TF formula (1 + log(tf)) to calculate TF for TF*IDF
